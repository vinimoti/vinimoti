## About me
Data science and analysis is the path that I follow, and I may have some missteps. And my main goal is to make into the data career!\
In my opinion data is a way to describe the world through a perspective that sounds more concrete, but not unbiased. We all have a personal bias and data is way to show us that bias and how wrong can it be.

## My projects
My list of projects may look like empty and without a lot of work on it and it's my fault. I usually tend to keep most of it for myself.
* **Titanic** was my main project for while where I explored a lot of classification in Machine Learning and exploited the randomness of the random grid search.
* **Credit Card Clutering** is a project where I devoloped during a class and went little further through the KNN
