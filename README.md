## About me
Data science and analysis is the path that I follow, and I may have some missteps. And my main goal is to make into the data career!\
In my opinion data is a way to describe the world through a perspective that sounds more concrete, but not unbiased. We all have a personal bias and data is way to show us that bias and how wrong can it be.
### Job?
I'm looking for a job and i'm currently developing this as a personal and professional portfolio (includes some serious projects, some learning and some personal)\

## My projects
My list of projects may look like empty and without a lot of work on it and it's my fault. I usually tend to keep the most of it for myself.
* [<image src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/Titanic_Kaggle-FFA500">](https://github.com/vinimoti/Titanic-Kaggle) was my main project for while where I explored a lot of classification in Machine Learning and exploited the randomness of the random grid search for some better results. This is one of my projects which I came with new ideas to try-on, like when I did use a lot of different techniques but sitck with the random grid search. In cases like this (a simpler and smaller dataset) the randomness is very cool to use and test with A LOT of different parameters.
* [<image src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/Credit_Card_Clustering-FFA500">](https://github.com/vinimoti/Credit-card-Cluster-training) is a project where I devoloped during a class and went little further through the KNN algorithm. This project I used some of my knowledge in financial to produce some insights in how to interprete the formed clusters.
* [<image src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/Whine_Multiclass_Classification-FFA500">](https://github.com/vinimoti/Multiclass-classification-case-wine) is another learning project developed during a class which i had to deal with a multiclass classifcation and used the confusion matrix to visualize how the predictions were being made in the testing dataset, also combining other metrics like recall, f-1 and precision and how these metrics have their own purpose.
